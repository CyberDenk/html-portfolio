<center><h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1></center>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>

<hr />

<h3>Hawksaw Ridge</h3>
    <p>This is one of the criziest and most beautiful war story that did happen, this what a human is supposed to do in his existence, pure heartful gestures.</p>

<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean</h3>
    <p>This one is not for only the story (even tho it's good too) but it's a mix of everything: the orchestra, the placement of these compositions, the sets, the costumes, the feeling to believe these people are at this point of time, i mean everything is too good, chills.</p>

<h3>How to Train your Dragon</h3>
    <p>This is clearly my favorite animation movie that has been made up til today: the main theme being 2 different melodies that gives you the best feeling when played together (test drive scene OMG), and just nailed toothless acting/personnification of the friendliest and most loyal entity to a human, just wanna cry thinking about it.</p>

<h4>Honorable Mention</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Beyond the Spider-Verse</li>
    <li>Hunger Games: Catching Fire</li>
    <li>Avatar</li>

</ul>
